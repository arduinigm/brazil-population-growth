# Brazilian Population Growth Analysis (1960–2010)

This project explores the population growth of Brazilian states using official census data from IBGE.
It focuses on calculating absolute and relative growth between 1960 and 2010 and visualizing the results with both traditional plots and a geographic heatmap.
**For educational purposes only.**

## 📊 Project Highlights

- ✅ Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- ✅ Calculation of population growth per state
- ✅ Bar chart for absolute population growth
- ✅ Line chart showing population trends over time
- ✅ Choropleth map (heatmap) of population growth using GeoPandas

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- geopandas
- shapely

---

## 📁 Data Sources

- **Population Data**: Historical census data from IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística)
- **Geographic Data**: Brazilian states shapefile from IBGE cartographic datasets

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- Southeastern and Midwestern states experienced the highest **absolute** population growth from 1960 to 2010.
- Northern states (e.g., Roraima, Amapá) showed high **relative** growth due to low initial population.
- Regional population trends reveal consistent expansion over the decades, with different intensities by region.

## 🗺️ Sample Visualizations

- Bar chart of absolute growth  
- Line plot showing each state's population curve  
- Choropleth heatmap of states colored by growth intensity

## 💡 Future Improvements

This is an introductory project. Potential next steps include:
- Modeling population projections
- Integrating socio-economic or environmental factors
- Time-series forecasting with machine learning
